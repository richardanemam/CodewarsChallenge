Codewars Challenge it's an application developed by Richard Anemam based on Codewars API. The app follows the MVVM architecture and makes use of retrofit for API resquests, 
dagger for dependency injection, livedata to evaluate states, viewbinding to bind views to data sources in a declarative way. Apart from that, the application is built in Kotlin
